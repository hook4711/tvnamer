# Change log

# `4.0` - unreleased
- Dropped support for EOL Python 2.7.

  ([Issue #150](https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/issues/150))

  - `show.0123.avi`
  ([Issue #140](https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/issues/140))

  ([PR #175](https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/pull/175))
- Files are now moved using `shutil.move` instead of custom logic around `os.rename`, which should make things more robust in situations with unusual partition setups (e.g Docker environments)
  ([PR #161](https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer/pull/161))
- Add command line argument to override language, e.g `tvnamer --lang de [...]`

- Dropping explicit support for EOL Python 3.3 and 3.4 (may still work but not tested)
